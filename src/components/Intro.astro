      I am a frontend developer with 17 years of experience. I am interested in
      modern web technologies and how I can use them in my daily work. I have
      been creating single page applications using React/TypeScript
      technologies. In the past, I have worked with many other frameworks, such
      as AngularJS and Backbone.js, developing applications for various
      platforms (mobile, automotive industry, financial/banking sector, etc.). I
      pay a lot of attention to optimizing application performance and code
      quality.
